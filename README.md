When we share our experiences of tourist places in Antwerpen, we must not neglect the zoo of Antwerp City. Another attraction and informative place in Belgium that marvels at visitors as well as kids. 
 The Zoo
Kids love to see animals as they have studied about them from their school life. When they see all beasts live, their excitement gets heightened. children love almost all the animals in the zoological garden. They can see all the beasts in an animal park. In Antwerpen Zoo, there are divergent categories of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. They are set up according to their habitats. The management of the wildlife place takes special care of the food of all the beasts
